# Introduction

## Aim of the class


At the end of this class, you will be able to:

- Create your own environment to run your Jupyter Notebook
- Create, run, export your own Jupyter Notebook
- Know about magic commands
- Use interactivity with a Jupyter Notebook

This last class is also to keep on praticing the notions learned in the previous lessons. 

# Jupyter Notebook

## What is Jupyter Notebook

A Jupyter Notebook is a computational notebook with the file extension `.ipynb`. It is a document that can combines text (formatted in plain text or Markdown), code (python, R, bash) and various visualizations (such as graphs, tables). It provides a friendly environment to format, explain and explore the results of a data analysis. Jupyter Notebooks can be exported to `.pdf` or `.html` to share them easily.

It is part of the [Project Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/), which is an umbrella project providing tools for interactive computing. JupyterLab provides an environment and user interface for Jupyter Notebooks. 

## How can I program in a Jupyter Notebook

### In your text editor 

To use Jupyter Notebook outside of a JupyterLab, your text editor must be compatible with the Jupyter Notebook format. In Visual Studio Code, you will need to install the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter). Some other extensions can be useful, for example [Jupyter Cell Tags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.vscode-jupyter-cell-tags).

### On a local server

If Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab is installed (report to [installation doc](https://jupyter.org/install)) on your computer, you can start running a local notebook server by running in the terminal:


```{bash}
jupyter notebook 
```

or

```{bash}
jupyter lab 
```

This will print some information about the notebook server in your console, and open a web browser to the URL of the local web application.

### Inside a JupyterLab
In the IGBMC, you can for example have access to a JupyterLab on the cluster with [Open OnDemand](https://it.igbmc.fr/open-ondemand).

For test purpose, you can also create a Jupyter Notebook in [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/). 


# Conda environment as a kernel

A Kernel is a computational engine for running and interacting with the Jupyter code. By default, Jupyter only knows about the base Python environment. This Python environment needs to have the necessary python library installed (e.g. `pandas`, `matplotlib`). 

In some cases, it might be useful to create different Python environments for different usage or projects. This ensures that you can install specific packages and Python versions without affecting your base system or other environments. For this purpose, a common tool used is [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). 

![Conda schema from [https://angus.readthedocs.io/](https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2019/conda_tutorial.html) ](img/conda.png){#fig-conda width=100%}

You can see it as a closed setup with its own Python interpreter and packages.

Some basic library like `pandas` or `matplotlib` are included in most already existing Kernels. But other library that are domain-specific won't be included by default. Also, you might want to work with a specific version of python or python packages.  
It is possible to register a Conda environment as a Kernel (so that Jupyter can use an environment with adequate packages to run code). 

```{bash}
# Run just once after installing conda, to actually start working in conda-mode
conda init 

# Open a new terminal (for conda init to be effective)
conda create -n python_intro python
conda activate python_intro
conda install ipykernel notebook

# In some JupyterLab instances you need to run the following:
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=python_intro 
```


::: {.callout-important title="Exercise"} 

Create the conda environment like above.
The environment should now be available as a Kernel in the selection.

Run the command `print('Hello World!')` in a cell. 

Run the command `import pandas` in a cell. If it does not work run in the terminal `conda install pandas` or `pip install pandas`, and once it's installed, try re-running the command `import pandas`. 

:::

As we are using conda, we might as well get familiar with some basic commands in conda.  

| Command                              | Description                                      |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `conda create -n env_name `          | Create a new environment                         |
| `conda create -n env_name package`   | Create a new environment with a specific package |
| `conda create -n env_name package==version`   | Create a new environment with a specific package and version |
| `conda activate env_name`            | Activate an environment                          |
| `conda deactivate`                   | Deactivate the current environment               |
| `conda list`                         | List all installed packages in the current env   |
| `conda env list`                     | List all available environments                  |
| `conda install package_name`         | Install a package in the current environment     |
| `conda remove package_name`          | Remove a package from the current environment    |
| `conda remove -n env_name --all`     | Remove an entire environment                     |
| `conda update package_name`          | Update a specific package                        |
| `conda update conda`                 | Update conda itself                              |
| `conda search package_name`          | Search for a package in conda repositories       |
| `conda info`                         | Display information about the conda installation |


::: {.callout-important title="Exercise"} 

Try the commands `conda list` and `conda env list`. Do you understand what they output?


Create an environment with pandas at version 1.5.3. You can verify the version of pandas with the following python code `print(pandas.__version__)`.


:::


::: {.content-hidden unless-meta="solutions"}
::: {.callout collapse="true" title="Solutions"}
`conda list` prints the packages available in the current environment. 

`conda env list` prints the conda environments available.

In a terminal run: 
```{bash}
conda create -n pandas_v1 pandas==1.5.3
conda activate pandas==1.5.3
python -c "import pandas; print(pandas.__version__)"
```

# Structure of a Jupyter Notebook  

## Cells 

In practice, a notebook consists of cells. A cell can contain Markdown or code. 
The execution of a code cell is dependent on the kernel used (for example, the kernel needs to have the adequate python packages installed). The results and warnings returned are displayed as the cell’s output. The output can be text, table, plot... 


::: {.callout-important title="Exercise"} 

Let's create our first Jupyter Notebook. For this create a new file and name it `lesson-3-companion.ipynb`. 
Before creating your Jupyter Notebook, (or before running your first cell) you will get asked to choose a Kernel. For the moment let's use the first one provided, we'll explain later what it is. 

Write a command in the first cells that says `print("Hello Jupyter")` and execute it. 

Write a command that will generate an error, for example `print("Hello Jupyter", end=1)` and execute it.

See associated [Jupyter Notebook](../exercise/jupyter-notebook/lesson-3-companion.ipynb) or its [html](../exercise/jupyter-notebook/lesson-3-companion.html) 

:::

:::

## Markdown 

The aim of a Jupyter Notebook is also to explain code. For this, we can write in the Markdown format descriptions of the experiment, the dataset, or general useful information about the analysis. 

In markdown, you can:

Create headers (i.e. titles with hierarchy):
```
# Header 1
# Header 2
## Subheader 1
```

Write in *italics*: `*italics*`

Write in **bold**: `**bold**`

Write [links](https://igbmc.fr): `[links](https://igbmc.fr)`

Add images ![alt text](img/jupyter.png){width=10%}: `![alt text](img/jupyter.png){width=10%}`

Create (nested) lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 1
  
```
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 1
```

Write in html: <p style="color:red;">This is in red.</p> ` <p style="color:red;">This is in red.</p>`

::: {.callout-important title="Exercise"} 

Let's rewrite some code of Exercise 3 of lesson 2 below into a Jupyter Notebook, with some explanation of the dataset and the code, using Markdown formatting.

Use at least the following Markdown elements: 

- header
- bold
- list
- link

And execute at least the following code (seperate it in different cells).

```{python}
#| eval: false

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('exercise/data/example.txt', index_col=0, sep=' ')
df = pd.melt(df, var_name='nucl', value_name='freq', ignore_index=False)

df.index
df.columns

df.head()

df['freq'].mean()
df.groupby("nucl")[['freq']].mean()
```

# Magic Commands

Magic commands are handy commands built into the IPython kernel.
You can get an explanation of all magic commands and usages in the [IPython doc](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html).
Here are a few that can be useful:


| Command  | Usage |  
|--|---|
| whos | Show a table of all vairables defined within the current notebook | 
| history | Display command history  | 
| time |  Measure execution time a Python statement or expression (line or cell) |  
| writefile <filename> |  Write the content of a cell into a file |  
| load |  Load content of an external python script into a cell |  
| run | Execute an external python script |  
| pip | Run the pip package manager within the current kernel | 

To use it in line mode add the prefix `%` before the command (e.g. `%time`). To use it in cell mode add the prefix `%%` (e.g. `%%time`). Some commands can only be used in one or the other mode. 

::: {.callout-important title="Exercise"} 

1. Load the file `analyse_fasta.py` that contains the functions `nucl_freq()` and `analyse_fasta()` into the next cell. Run the command `nucl_freq("AACTTG")` to verify that it worked.

2. Use a magic command to get all the variables currently defined. Remove the functions `nucl_freq` and `analyse_fasta` variable using `del <variable>` in python and rerun the magic command to output all variables currently defined.

3. Run the file `analyse_fasta.py` that contains the functions `nucl_freq()` and `analyse_fasta()`. Run the command `nucl_freq("AACTTG")` to verify that it worked.

# Exporting notebook 

JupyterLab allows you to export your jupyter notebook files (`.ipynb`) into other file formats such as:

- HTML `.html`
- LaTeX `.tex`
- Markdown `.md`
- PDF `.pdf`
- Executable Script `.py`

Converting the notebook uses the module [`nbconvert`](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) and the availability of certain conversions will depend on `nbconvert` configuration.

On a JupterLab instance, you will be able to export your notebook with `File > Save and Export Notebook As`. 

In the Visual Studio Code, exporting can be done with the button (on the same bar as `+ Code`) `... > Export` or via the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) `>Jupyter: Export to ...`.

::: {.callout-important title="Exercise"} 
Export `lesson-3-companion.ipynb` in a `.html` format. Open the `.html` file into a browser.

# Interactive notebook

## Widgets

An interesting thing about notebook is to make them interactive. For this we will use the [interact](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Using%20Interact.html) function of `ipywidgets`. 

It can take different values as input (integer, boolean, string):

```{python}
#| eval: false

from ipywidgets import interact

def f(x):
    return x

interact(f, x=10)

interact(f, x=True)

interact(f, x='Hi there!')

interact(f, x=['Choice A', 'Choice B'])
```

Or more than one value:
```{python}
#| eval: false

def f(w, x, y, z,):
    return (w, x, y, z)

interact(f, w=10, x=True, y='Hi there!', z=['Choice A', 'Choice B'])
```

The type of value given calls for a specific widget (slider, check box, text box), that can be parametered. Here is a summary:

| Type of value | Widget function | Usage example |
|-|-|-|
| Boolean | Checkbox() |  `True` or `False` | 
| String | Text() | `'Hi there'` | 
| Integer | IntSlider() | `value` or `(min,max)` or `(min,max,step)` if integers are passed | 
| Float  | FloatSlider() | `value` or `(min,max)` or `(min,max,step)` if floats are passed | 
| List | Dropdown() | `['orange','apple']` or `[('one', 1), ('two', 2)]` | 

There are actually many more widgets, they can be found in [ipywidget documentation](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/7.x/examples/Widget%20List.html). 


::: {.callout-warning} 
The interactivity is only kept in the Jupyter Notebook format `.ipynb` as it needs the Kernel to be run. That means that these interactive elements will not be exported in the `.html` format for example. 

Which is also why the exmaples given in this website are not interactive!
::: 


::: {.callout-important title="Exercise"} 

Create an interactive plot based on the stacked bar chart from lesson 2. It should show the frequencies of only one (interactively) selected nucleotide for each sequence.

Export it in `.html`. 

Bonus: allow for the choice of multiple nucleotides. 

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from ipywidgets import interact
from ipywidgets import widgets

# Create a DataFrame from the given data
df = pd.read_csv('exercise/data/example.txt', index_col=0, sep=' ')

def interactive_plot(columns):
    # Plot the data
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=(5, 6))

    bottom = pd.Series([0,0,0,0,0], index = df.index) 
    for col in columns:
        ax.bar(df.index, df[col], label=col, bottom=bottom)
        bottom += df[col]

    # Add labels and legend
    ax.set_xlabel('Sequences')
    ax.set_ylabel('Frequency')
    ax.legend(title='Nucleotides', bbox_to_anchor=(0, 1),
              loc='lower left', ncols=4)
    plt.show()

interact(interactive_plot, columns=df.columns)

interact(interactive_plot, columns=widgets.SelectMultiple(
    options=df.columns,
    value=[df.columns[0], df.columns[1]],
    description='Nucleotides',
    disabled=False
))
```

## Plotly express

`plotly.express` is a module used to create figures that are interactive. 
Refer to its [documentation](https://plotly.com/python/) for more information.


::: {.callout-warning} 
It does not rely on the same grammar as `matplotlib`, so you have to get used to new objects and functions to create plots. We will not cover it here, but it is useful to know that `plotly.express` exists when creating Jupyter Notebooks
::: 

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('exercise/data/example.txt', sep=' ')
df = pd.melt(df, var_name='nucl', value_name='freq', id_vars=['Seq'])

fig = px.bar(df, x="Seq", y="freq", color = "nucl", title="Nucleotide frequency")
fig.show()

```

# Final exercise 

::: {.callout-important title="Exercise"} 

Download the `GSE165691_DEG_result_table.xlsx` file from [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE165691). 

Create a new Jupyter Notebook to analyze this dataset. Use markdown cells as necessary to explain the process and results of the analysis. Throughout the notebook, use the following markdown elements:

- header
- bold
- links
- lists

1. Load the dataset into the Notebook using pandas.

::: {.callout collapse="true" title="Hint"}
Run the magic command `%pip install openpyxl` inside a cell of the Notebook. 
Now you can use `pd.read_excel()`! 
:::

2. Explore the datatable and describe it (number of rows, columns, column names and what they contain...). Importantly, get the following information: 

- are there any value that are null? If so in which columns?
- number of unique genes
- min, max and mean of log2FC
- number genes with of padj < 0.05
- number of significantly up- and down-regulated genes (up: `log2FC > 1` and `padj < 0.05` and down: `log2FC < -1` and `padj < 0.05`)

::: {.callout collapse="true" title="Hint"}
For the last two information, you can make good use of either `.sum()` or `.value_counts()`.
:::

3. Get the following values: 

- the expression in both samples of the genes: Il31ra, Sox9, Lbp
- the gene with the highest log2FoldChange, and the gene with the lowest log2FoldChange. 

::: {.callout collapse="true" title="Hint"}
For the last one, you can use `.idxmin()`, see [doc](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.idxmax.html)
:::

4. Make a histogram plot of the log2FoldChange.

::: {.callout collapse="true" title="Hint"}
pandas has built-in [plot](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html) functions that are based on matplotlib.
:::

5. Make a pie plot that gives the proportion of positive-log2FoldChange genes and negative-log2FoldChange genes. 

::: {.callout collapse="true" title="Hint"}
Compute the number of positive and negative log2FoldChange first. Then use `plt.pie()`. 
:::

6. Make a volcano plot where up-regulated genes are red points, down-regulated genes are blue points, and other are grey. 

::: {.callout collapse="true" title="Hint"}
Create a new column called `color` that has the value `red` for up-regulated genes, `blue` for down-regulated genes, and `grey` for others. 
::: 

7. Just like 6 but make it interactive with widgets so that you can change the threshold of log2FoldChange and padj. 

8. Just like 6 but make it interactive with plotly expression so that you can hoover your mouse on a point and get the name of the gene, and some other informations available about that gene (e.g. `'ensembl_gene_id', 'log2FoldChange', 'padj', 'symbol','PR661W_Vec', 'PR661W_TRPM1'`). 

::: {.callout collapse="true" title="Hint"}
`plotly.express` behaves differently than `matplotlib`. You can create a new column called `color` that has the value `up-regulated` for up-regulated genes, `down-regulated` for down-regulated genes, and `Non-significant` for others. 
::: 

9. Make a heatmap of the top 5 up-regulated and top 5 down-regulated (based on `log2FoldChange`) genes where the color corresponds to the log value of `norm.count.mean` column.
    
::: {.callout collapse="true" title="Hint"}
One way to order by absolute value of a column is: `df.sort_values(..., key=lambda x: abs(x))`.

Use `np.log()` from `numpy` package. 
::: 

10. Export the notebook in html.
