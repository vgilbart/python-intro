# Introduction

## Aim of the class

This last class is to pratice the notions learned on a couple of (larger) exercises. 

::: {.column-margin}
![*pssssss*](img/potter.jpg){#fig-potter width=100%}
:::

The exercises have one provided solution, but it is not the only one. We all have a different coding style, and it evolves with time. So do not worry if you have a different solution, as long as your result is correct, that's already great!


## Requirements

Remembering some of [lesson 1](../lecture/lesson-1.html) and [2](../lecture/lesson-2.html).
